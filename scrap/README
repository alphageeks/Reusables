scrap (scrot + append) is a tool for combining scraps of visible content from multiple sources into a single file.

scrot is a requirement.

scrap <filename> does the following:
1. It waits for you to select a portion of the screen you want to save.
2a. If filename does not exist, it saves the screenshot as that filename.
2b. If filename exists, it appends the screenshot below the existing image.
